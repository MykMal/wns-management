This repository contains source code for simulating the mathematical model described in the paper "Management Efficacy in a Metapopulation Model of White-nose Syndrome" by J Duan, MM Malakhov, JJ Pellett, IS Phadke, J Barber, and JC Blackwood. The manuscript is currently under review, and a link to it will be added here upon publication.

Run the following scripts to recreate the plots included in the paper:

* `ContourPlot.m` produces Figure 2
* `SurvivalVsControl.m` produces Figure 3
* `ControlsSummary.m` produces Figure 4
* `SurvivalVsDispersal.m` produces Figure 5
* `ControlsPercentChangeSummary.m` produces Figure 6

Additional instructions can be found in the comments within each program file.
