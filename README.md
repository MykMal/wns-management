This repository contains source code for simulating the mathematical model described in the paper "Management efficacy in a metapopulation model of white-nose syndrome" by J Duan, MM Malakhov, JJ Pellett, IS Phadke, J Barber, and JC Blackwood. Our paper was published in the journal *Natural Resource Modeling* and is accessible at [https://doi.org/10.1111/nrm.12304](https://doi.org/10.1111/nrm.12304).

Run the following scripts to recreate the plots included in the paper:

* `ContourPlot.m` produces Figure 2
* `SurvivalVsControl.m` produces Figure 3
* `ControlsSummary.m` produces Figure 4
* `SurvivalVsDispersal.m` produces Figure 5
* `ControlsPercentChangeSummary.m` produces Figure 6

Additional instructions can be found in the comments within each program file.
